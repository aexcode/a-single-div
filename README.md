## Project Details
This project was inspired by [Lynn Fisher's project](https://github.com/lynnandtonic/a-single-div) of the same name. It is an exploration into all that can be done with a single div and some css. No, it's not the most practical art form, but it's a fun way to learn more about css. 

This project uses [Pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) for templating, [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) for css preprocessing and [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) for the development workflow. 

Each design can also be found on in my [A Single Div Codepen Collection](https://codepen.io/collection/pgowkP), where you can fork and play around with the code with ease.

## Prerequisites 
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)

This project utilizes Gulp for the development workflow. If you just want to view the project, feel free to run `open src/index.html ` (Mac) to open the project in the browser. If you would like to play around with the code, check out the available gulp commands below. `gulp sync` is ideal for development.

Feel free to copy/paste as much as you'd like, to edit, and to experiment. That is, after all the point of the project! If you reuse a significant portion of CSS or full drawings, credit would be appreciated!
